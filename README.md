## Overview
Customer churn prediction is a vital aspect for businesses to retain their customer base. By analyzing customer behavior and patterns, we aim to predict which customers are likely to churn so that proactive measures can be taken to retain them. In this project, we have implemented popular machine learning algorithms and performed in-depth analysis to create efficient prediction models.
